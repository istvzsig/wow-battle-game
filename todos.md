## âœ… STEP 1: Define the Core Game Concept

Before jumping into code, clarify:

### ðŸŽ® Game Design Goals

- Style: Turn-based RPG (text or simple 2D graphics)
- Characters: Choose class (e.g. Warrior, Mage, Druidâ€¦)
- Combat: PvE to start, maybe PvP later
- Progression: Leveling, XP, Gold, Loot
- UI: Inventory, Character screen, Battle screen

## âœ… STEP 2: Plan the Project Structure

### Backend (Go)

- REST API or WebSocket (initially use REST)
- Models:
  - Player (Name, Class, Level, Stats)
  - Monster (Name, HP, Damage)
  - Combat (Turn-based logic)
  - Inventory, Items
- Database: SQLite or in-memory for now

**Frontend (JavaScript)**

- Plain JS or a framework (weâ€™ll use vanilla JS at first)
- Pages:
  - Character Creation
  - Battle View
  - Inventory
  - Main Menu

## ðŸ”§ Step 3.1: Backend (Go)

We'll write a basic Go API with 2 endpoints:

- /create â€“ Create a player
- /battle â€“ Simulate a turn-based fight against a monster
